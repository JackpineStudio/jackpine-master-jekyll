	Copy/image match up problesm
		- Coldwell Banker: copy and images don't really match up in the last section.copy talks about the humorous landing page, but image is of the blog.  picture should be of the landing page, preferably with Ross pointing somewhere.
		- Hydropothecary: the "inspired by nature" paragraph is about the crafting of the mark, but is paired with a product mockup. this is dumb. 	
		- SuzyQ: sweet swag section is about t-shirts, but t-shirt picture is down at the bottom
		- SuzyQ packaging: can we use a mockup of the box instead of the blueprint? it's not super easy to visual what's happening with this image.
