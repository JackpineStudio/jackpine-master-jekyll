            <h2>Marc Garneau for the Liberal Leadership</h2>
            <h3>A Canadian Hero</h3>
            <p>
            Marc Garneau was the first Canadian in space. He is the epitome of a national hero, but late in the game, his campaign for Liberal leadership was in need of a boost. He needed a way to reach Liberal voters and get them excited about him as a leader.

            <p>
            The Canadian public needed to be reminded of just how important Marc Garneau was to Canada’s history and its future. We crafted a story using archival TV footage to pay homage to Garneau's rocket-fueled trajectory into history as Canada's first astronaut in space.

            <p>
            Although Garneau did not win the Liberal leadership, he remains a national hero that resonates with the Canadian public. Our video was viewed almost three thousand times—more than any of his other campaign videos combined.
