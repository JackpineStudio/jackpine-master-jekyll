            <h2>Chinatown BIA Ottawa</h2>
            <h3>New Energy. New Approach.</h3>
            <p>
            Ottawa’s Chinatown has always been known as a culinary and cultural destination. But over the past few years, it’s also become a hotbed for the city’s artistic community. The Chinatown BIA knew they needed to reach out to a younger generation with a new approach.

            <h3>Experimental Mark Creation</h3>
            <p>
            We began by creating a new mark that captured the excitement and energy of Chinatown. We took the Chinatown mark and splashed it overtop of a traditional ornament found in almost every shop and restaurant in the neighbourhood.

            <h3>Inspired by Place</h3>
            <p>
            The brochure reflects the neighbourhood’s past—and its future. We drew inspiration from the creativity that is already bubbling up in the neighbourhood, and designed a map that showcased the series of Ottawa School of Art murals that dot the cityscape.

            <h3>The Finer Details</h3>
            <p>
            We playfully referenced the area’s roots with witty fortune cookies that reveal the many sides of living in Chinatown, and included a checklist of things one must do when visiting the ‘hood.
