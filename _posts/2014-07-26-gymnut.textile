            <h3>Creating the brand</h3>
            <p>
            Gymnut came to us because they needed help branding a new app they were developing for Android and iOS. The software, geared toward personal trainers and gym members alike, is a tool for managing workouts and diet plans.

            <h3>Visualising the app</h3>
            <p>
           The app, which connects personal trainers and gym members, needed a visual identity. We developed colour schemes, icons, and a slick UI that made it easy to share routines and meal plans and track progress.

            <h3>The brand in the wild</h3>
            <p>
            Today Gymnut has a living brand that they are using to further develop their business. They continue to develop a smartphone app that is useful and intuitive for both personal trainers and gym members.
