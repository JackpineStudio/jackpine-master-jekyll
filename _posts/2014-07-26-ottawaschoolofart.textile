            <h3>Art for Art School</h3>
            <p>
            The Ottawa School of Art needed to find a way to promote their Brown Bag lecture series, a free lunch-time lecture series with some of Ottawa’s most renowned artists. But they needed to do it in a way that stayed true to their creative spirit.

            <h3>Time-Lapse Art Attack</h3>
            <p>
            Inspired by the British kids’ show Art Attack, Jackpine created a video that went back to our childhood roots of creativity and wonder. Using time-lapse technology and the OSA logo, Jackpine created a playful, joyful video that made people want to learn.
